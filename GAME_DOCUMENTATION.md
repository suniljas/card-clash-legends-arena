## 1. Game Core & Strategic Identity

### Revolutionary Combat: "Position Matters"

**The Strategic Signature**: Card Clash Legends Arena is defined by its lane-based positional combat system that makes every placement decision strategically meaningful.

#### Battlefield Structure
- **Melee Lane (Front)**: Units can attack opponents directly but are vulnerable to counterattacks
- **Ranged Lane (Back)**: Protected units that support the front line with indirect attacks
- **Lane Capacity**: Melee (4 units max), Ranged (3 units max) for tactical resource management

#### Positional Keywords
- **Guard**: Can block attacks from any lane, protecting vulnerable allies
- **Flank**: Can attack units in adjacent lanes, enabling tactical positioning
- **Artillery**: Can attack opponents directly from ranged lane if melee lane is clear
- **Formation**: Gains bonuses when adjacent to same-tribe allies

#### Strategic Impact
This system transforms every match into a spatial puzzle where:
- **Deck Building** must consider unit positioning and lane synergy
- **Combat Decisions** involve not just what to play, but where to play it
- **Counterplay** requires anticipating opponent positioning and planning counters
- **Skill Expression** emerges through mastery of positional tactics

### Core Pillars
1. **Positional Mastery**: Strategic depth through meaningful spatial decisions
2. **Ethical Progression**: Fair F2P model without pay-to-win mechanics
3. **Living Community**: Dynamic events and player-driven content
4. **Competitive Integrity**: Skill-based gameplay with robust anti-cheat systems

## 2. Ethical Economy Revolution

### The Wildcard System: Fair Collection Building

**Philosophy**: Every player should have access to competitive decks through skill and time investment, not monetary advantage.

#### How It Works
1. **Duplicate Protection**: Excess cards automatically convert to crafting materials
2. **Shards**: Primary crafting currency earned from duplicate cards and gameplay
3. **Wildcard Essence**: Premium crafting material from high-rarity duplicates
4. **Wildcards**: Universal cards that can be redeemed for any card of the same rarity

#### Crafting Costs (Balanced for Fair Progression)
- **Common Wildcard**: 100 Shards
- **Rare Wildcard**: 300 Shards + 10 Essence  
- **Epic Wildcard**: 800 Shards + 25 Essence
- **Legendary Wildcard**: 2000 Shards + 50 Essence

#### Sources of Materials
- **Gameplay Rewards**: Daily quests, weekly vault, faction progression
- **Duplicate Cards**: Automatic conversion to prevent collection bloat
- **Battle Pass**: Enhanced progression track with wildcard rewards
- **Achievements**: Long-term goals with meaningful material rewards

#### Benefits Over Trading
- **No Market Manipulation**: Stable, predictable progression
- **Beginner Friendly**: New players aren't priced out by market inflation
- **Security**: No risk of scams, account theft, or economic exploitation
- **Competitive Balance**: Meta driven by strategy, not wallet size
